**Notes:**
- Should follow https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout
- This is a learning experience too, so some code, more specifically docker pkg is for fun and should not be used seriously. Only wanted to write parts of it for learning more about the docker API

**TODOS:**
- Investigate net.dial and if we need to close unix socket after in the docker pkg
- Copy paste code in docker/pkg default_impl, check how to make it better
